# School-Assignments
Welcome to my School-Assignments C++ Programs Repository! This repository contains a collection of C++ programs that I have worked on during my time at Kenya Coast National Poly.
These programs cover various concepts in C++ programming and are meant to showcase my learning and skills.

## Usage
The repository contains the source code (`*.cpp`), for each program.
After cloning the repository and navigating to its directory, you can compile and run the individual programs using your C++ compiler. For example, using g++:

1. Compile a program
2. Run the compiled program
